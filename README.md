# What Have the Mars Rovers Seen?

## Description:
This web application allows the users to look at images from the NASA Mars Rover Photo API captured by four of the Mars Rovers while/as they are active in their missions. The user can select a particular date and camera from Perseverance, Curiosity, Opportunity and Spirit to view if any images were captured that particular day.

## Usage:
The user navigates to the particular rover they would like to view images from, selects a date and camera, and clicks submit. An image will be pulled from the API if there is one. If not, an image describing the cameras on the rovers will render.

## Support:
At this time support is not availble.

## Roadmap:
Add funtionality allowing users to cycle through all pictures from a particular camera on a particular day.

Add a map of Mars showing where the rover was on the date selected.
